## Abstract

[Stance4Health](http://www.stance4health.com/) is an [European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/218510/factsheet/es) fosters a global ecosystem while enabling collection, management, and analysis of healthcare and feeding data, with the aim of developing a Smart Personalized Nutrition service, based on food production that will optimize the gut microbiota activity.
It will be tailored to different target groups, from healthy children and adults to children with coeliac disease or food allergy, 
as well as overweight children and adults, which will have an impact on the development of NCDs such as obesity or type 2 diabetes. 
The specific personalised nutrition tools developed along Stance4Health will be based on robust scientific evidence and knowledge 
from different fields like nutrition, medicine, food sciences, microbiology, computer sciences, and social sciences and humanities 
like economics, marketing, psychology and social anthropology.

In this document you can see how the project is being implemented, what technologies will be used, what programming tecnic is most appropriate, and
how the data will be treated in terms of management and migration.
This repository was created with the purpose of collecting information for the development of Stance4Health.  

At the moment, you can find information about:

- [Representation of Food Composition databases](https://github.com/Stance4Health-Dev/docs/tree/master/data-representation) like [FDA](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/nutrient-data-laboratory/docs/sr28-download-files/), [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), [Intake24](https://intake24.co.uk/) and so on.
